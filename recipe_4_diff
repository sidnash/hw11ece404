BB10 has launched.Â Adam Leach, principal analyst at Ovum, provides his initial reaction:

âThe Blackberry 10 platform offers a differentiated user experience in todayâs crowded and homogenous smartphone market. The Blackberry Z10 and Q10 will stand out from the Android masses and look distinct from Appleâs iPhone. The user experience of Blackberry 10 introduces some nice new features but importantly builds on Blackberryâs UI heritage and therefore will certainly appeal to existing Blackberry users. However, the challenge for the company will be to attract new users and those that have already moved to alternative smartphones.

"Blackberry has rightly focused on insuring that the Blackberry 10 devices have a large catalogue of content and applications which is now essential for any modern smartphone, and achieving 70,000 applications at the launch of a new platform is good start.

"However, Ovum believes that despite a well-designed Blackberry 10 platform, that will certainly attract short-term interest from existing users the company will struggle to appeal to a wider audience and in the long-term will become a niche player in the smartphone market."

Oracle has announced its intent to acquire vendor Acme Packets. Dana Cooperson, principal analyst believes the acquisition should strengthen Oracleâs hand both with enterprises and carriers by giving it a more central role in controlling and improving how devices and subscribers interact and communicate.

Cooperson comments:

âOracleâs move to acquire Acme Packets illustrates several very important on-going trends in global communications:

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  âIT and Telecom are rapidly blending: Telecom and IT are coming together in ways that are shifting the vendor competitive framework significantly. IT-focused companies like Oracle see a real opportunity to strengthen their position in both markets through extending their product lines and are acting aggressively. Companies that specialize in either telecom or IT will need a strategy of how they will benefit from this blending of what were two largely separate domains. Any vendor that wants to be a full-service partner to the telcos and other large communications and content providers will need such a blended strategy to be credible. Specialists will need to align with full-service partners.

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  âSoftware increasingly driving network capabilities: Although hardware is still important in many applications to provide needed performance, software is more and more critical for both differentiating and monetizing network capabilities. Performance without monetization is only half the equation.

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  âCommunications needs are anytime, anywhere: People want to be connected, at work or at play, through a variety of devices and access means. Controlling these sessions securely and at the needed quality is increasingly critical.â

Cooperson added: âOracle Communications has a value proposition that encompasses telcos, enterprises, and other ICT (information and communications technology) infrastructure vendors. In fact, Oracle both sells to and competes with telecom infrastructure vendors. But unlike many of these companies, Oracle has a comparatively large bucket of cash to use for acquisitionsâ as a communications infrastructure vendor bested only by Cisco. Oracle and Cisco can both afford to be aggressive with M&A whereas many of their peers cannot. Expect the buying spree to continue.â

Meanwhile according to research by Principal Analyst, Matt Walker telecom-centric vendors are having a tough time, again, as in the last several quarters they have seen margins decrease significantly; 4Q12 earnings issued to date have not reversed the trend:

âEven with some consolidation and extensive layoffs, several big vendors (e.g., Alcatel-Lucent) are hurting. A weak capex climate among service providers has worsened the outlook, as has the continued growth of Huawei. Ovumâs latest forecast calls for telecom capex bumps in some country markets, but Chinese vendors are positioned well in many of these. In the near-term, vendor earnings should be watched closely, with an eye on both margins and cash conservation. In the longer-term, consolidation will help, but this is never easy; slow integration is the biggest challenge to this approach. Looking ahead to âwhat you want to be when you grow upâ is a better approach as the IT and telecom worlds converge. This blending impacts network design, product choice, sales models, purchasing decisions, and ultimately the competitive landscape.âÂ

Dell is on its way to open a new chapter in the IT industry by taking the company private. A move, which according to Carter Lusher, chief IT analyst at Ovum, makes strategic sense:

âDell is in the midst of a wrenching transition from a supplier of commodity hardware, mainly traditional PCs, to being a supplier of enterprise-grade IT infrastructure. Dellâs ambition is nothing less than offering the entire IT stack with supporting services. A significant risk likely to face Dell during this transition is that enterprises and public sector organizations cut back on their purchases âuntil the dust settles.â

âThe implication of going private is that Dell is planning radical changes to its strategy and product roadmap. While the company might come out of this transition stronger with a product lineup that better meets the needs of businesses and public sector organizations, there will be uncertainty as to what products and services stay, get strengthen, or get eliminated.Â  

âOvum sees effective communication to prospects and customers about its strategy and product roadmap as a, if not the, critical success factor to get through the transition. While this might sound simple it is not. Compounding Dellâs challenge is the deep seated brand identity as a âPC company.âÂ  Another communications challenge will be how Dell Services (built on the Perot acquisition) shares its financials for the due diligence phase on large, multi-year IT services deals.

âOvum recommends that CIOs need to asset the risk to their infrastructure and put into place plans should Dellâs radical hardware, software, and services shifts require changes to procurement plans.â

Ovumâs Regulatory Scorecard 2013 reveals huge disparities in regulatory environments worldwide

For immediate release

London, 13 February, 2013 â In the second iteration of its annual Regulatory Scorecard*, Ovum finds that competition and investment in the global telecoms industry is being held back by inconsistent regulatory frameworks.

Having assessed and ranked the regulatory performance of 11 countries across three geographic areas, the global analyst firm noted that countries getting the worst ranks across the board were those with generally less competitive markets, and the lack of competition is often due to the uncertainty around the frameworks that are in place.

âIn Japan and South Korea, for example, the relationship between the government and the regulator could be perceived as too close. Independence from political involvement is important in ensuring a credible NRA, whose decisions may be challenged through an effective appeals process,â said analyst James Robinson, co-author of the Scorecard.

Although Ovumâs Scorecard highlights similarities between countries within the same geographic region, significant differences occur across regions in most areas of regulatory activity. For instance, the regulation of the wholesale fixed sector differs from country to country, and from region to region, mainly due to the varying uptake of copper- and fiber-based fixed broadband. Countries within the same region are often ranked very differently; for example, Mexico appears significantly below its counterparts in South and Central America for almost every respect of the regulatory environment.

âWhile Colombia and Brazil are making progress in setting out a stable framework which reflects the industryâs developments, the regulatory process in Mexico appears confusing and slow. This inevitably leads to inefficiency in most areas of regulation,â said analyst Luca Schiavoni, the other co-author of the Scorecard.

By contrast, spectrum policy is one area in which current best practice can be observed across most countries. As the volume of mobile data traffic has grown considerably over the past few years, many regulators have acted to liberalize certain spectrum bands from previous technological restrictions. Ovumâs Scorecard also notes that regulators are awarding more frequencies for the development of next-generation mobile broadband. âNo one country appears willing to be left out from the opportunities of 4G. This is particularly true in South and Central America, where mobile connections go a very long way toward getting people online,â concluded Schiavoni.

Consumer protection is also now more important to regulators all over the world. As Ovumâs research shows, NRAs across Asia-Pacific, Europe, and South and Central America are aiming to guarantee a certain quality of service for usersâ Internet connections, and to ensure that those users can easily switch between providers. Nevertheless, some countries must still work to improve transparency, in particular concerning the advertising of broadband speeds and traffic management policies.
